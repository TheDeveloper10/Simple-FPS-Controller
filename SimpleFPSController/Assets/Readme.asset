    text: 'This template is a good starting point for developers focused platform reach.
      The Universal Render Pipeline offers both real-time lighting and baked lighting
      in a single-pass forward renderer. This decreases the amount of necessary draw
      calls, making Universal RP idea for projects that must scale across platforms, including
      mobile hardware. Universal RP also has an optimized 2D renderer, complete with 2D
      lights and features like pixel perfect rendering.'
